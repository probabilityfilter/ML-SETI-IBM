# Machine Learning Using SETI data
[SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)](https://www.seti.org/) Institute is dedicated to answering one of the most interesting questions â€“ is there intelligent life elsewhere in the universe? To this end it runs the [Allen Telescope Array](https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/fact-sheet), a radio telescope array in Hat Creek Radio Observatory, northern California, which observes radio signals from distant stars and nebulae. Their existing detection software does a simple real-time search for signals that are greater than the average noise. If it persists for more than a few seconds then the software flags the observation and calls for human intervention. Needless to say, this is a very broad classification and catches all types of signals with no regard to their periodicity, uniqueness, or shape.
